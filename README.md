1. # <a name="_toc126937322"></a>Related work
Studies and publications in the field of digital forensics have shown a growing interest in the examination of social media and instant messaging platforms, with a particular focus on Android app systems.

The objective of this paper [1] is to identify and gather valuable data and information that might be present on Android devices, specifically those left behind by the TikTok app, for the purpose of digital forensics. By conducting this investigation, they hope to determine whether any illegal activities are taking place through the usage of this app and provide evidence to support their findings. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the data that can be retrieved from TikTok-enabled Android devices, so as to support further inquiry into potential criminal activity. 

In the paper [2], the authors employ a diverse range of analysis methods to thoroughly examine the data ownership and privacy implications of the FacePlay application. These methods include reverse engineering, database analysis, network traffic analysis, steganography analysis, security posture evaluation, and a careful examination of the application's End-User License Agreement (EULA) and privacy agreements. Through their use of these various analysis techniques, the authors aim to uncover any digital artifacts that may shed light on the privacy and data ownership issues associated with the FacePlay application. Their goal is to provide valuable insights into the security and privacy implications of using this popular application and to help inform users about the risks involved.

In this paper [3], the authors present a comprehensive case study in which they apply forensic techniques to examine data stored on nine of the most popular proximity-based dating apps. The aim of this study was to determine the types of information that can be recovered from user devices and to assess the potential privacy implications of using these apps. Through their investigation, the authors were able to recover a wide range of data types from these apps, including personal information, chat logs, and location data. These findings raise important concerns about user privacy and the security of the data that is stored on these popular dating apps.

The purpose of this article [4] is to determine the location of data after using five popular social networking apps: Instagram, LINE, Whisper, WeChat, and Wickr. Through the utilization of three digital forensics tools, Magnet AXIOM, XRY, and Autopsy, this study performs data extraction and analysis to recover information that could be valuable for future criminal investigations. The final objective of this research is to evaluate the performance of these tools in terms of their ability to extract digital evidence from the device and to compare their results against the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards.

This paper [5] focuses on the forensic analysis of five popular dating apps (Her, Hily, Hinge, Ok Cupid, and Plenty of Fish (POF)) that can be found on both Android and iOS devices. The research aims to uncover the information that can be retrieved about the sender from the receiver's device and to identify any potential privacy issues that arise from the recoverable data. Additionally, the paper outlines the steps that should be taken during a forensic investigation and provides a comprehensive guide on the location of relevant data for forensic investigators. The study concludes by discussing the implications of the recoverable data for the privacy of app users.

1. ## <a name="_toc126937324"></a>**Devices/Apps**
After reading some papers on forensic programs, we came to the conclusion that running Tinder analysis on an operating system based on the Linux kernel will make our work significantly more effective. So what we did was build up a virtual environment using VMware Workstation 17 Pro with the Kali Linux 2022 operating system.

- Over 600 different forensics and testing tools are included in the Kali Linux distribution, which is based on Debian and was developed specifically for use in penetration testing and digital forensics.
- We will be using Kali Linux on VMware Workstation 17 Pro, which is a tool that enables users to set up virtual machines on the most physical machine possible and share the same resources as the server.
- We use Android Studio and the Android 7.1.1 version of Tinder to run it on the Kali virtual machine. Tinder 14.1.0 was released on 1/2/2023.
  - Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. Android Studio can do Android virtualization - Android Virtual Devices (AVD), we will use AVD to run Tinder application for digital forensics

1. ## <a name="_toc126937325"></a>**Forensic tools**
- The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is the first tool that needs to be used in order to analyze and extract data from Tinder. ADB is able to connect to Android Studio devices, carry out essential commands, and interact between devices, user operating systems, and device operating systems.
- We will utilize SQLite Database Browser to read conveniently accessible extracted data. With the help of this tool, we can read data that has been organized into a table, making it simpler to analyze.
- Next, in order to do reversing, we need a program that can dump information from Tinder. The Android Asset Packaging Tool, also known as aapt, will assist us in decompiling Tinder's APK file and dumping all of the information it contains.
- About network packet analysis, we make use of wireshark, which is a piece of software designed specifically for network analysis. This allows us to capture network packets, investigate the protocols that Tinder employs to encrypt data, and verify the safety of packets before they are sent over the network.

- Next, Fill in your personal information, such as your full name, birthday, gender, sexual orientation, location, personal hobbies, profile photo, and so on.

![Aspose Words 4262bab1-4a8f-4c6c-8240-7d23d4d7e40d 008](https://github.com/plue0709/Specialized_Project/assets/80806913/614d5b86-6229-44bd-8c57-aac530b55532)




- Tinder will utilize personal information, information about you, distance, and other factors to recommend items for you to pick from; if you agree to 'like' the object, swipe right; if you disagree, swipe left.

- If they both like each other, they will be able to text each other, examine each other's profiles, and eventually form a relationship.


![Aspose Words 4262bab1-4a8f-4c6c-8240-7d23d4d7e40d 009](https://github.com/plue0709/Specialized_Project/assets/80806913/0b2fdbe7-cfb0-4d13-b6ff-6bd70660652e)

1. ## <a name="_toc126937328"></a>**Install Android studio and ADB debugging connect to the target devices**
- After completing the installation process for Android Studio on our Kali Linux, we then moved on to emulating an Android device using the software's built-in emulator. This provided us with the ability to simulate the usage of an actual Android device, which is essential for testing and evaluating the functionality of mobile applications. In our specific scenario, we utilized the emulator to install the popular dating app, Tinder, so that we can easily verify the application.

![Aspose Words 4262bab1-4a8f-4c6c-8240-7d23d4d7e40d 011](https://github.com/plue0709/Specialized_Project/assets/80806913/790d3a70-feb3-4cf6-bf24-f4d14cb329fd)


- The use of ADB (Android Debug Bridge) debugging allows for a connection to be established between a development machine and an Android device. This connection facilitates the transfer of data and commands between the two, allowing for in-depth debugging and testing of the device's software and applications. By utilizing ADB debugging, developers can access the Android device's file system, process list, logcat output, and other information that can be extremely useful in identifying and fixing issues within the software.

![Aspose Words 4262bab1-4a8f-4c6c-8240-7d23d4d7e40d 012](https://github.com/plue0709/Specialized_Project/assets/80806913/d4f5b73a-f0f3-465e-be40-65b73e54eeb0)

1. ## <a name="_toc126937329"></a>**Using ADB debugging to pull data from Tinder and analyzing those ones to get useful evidence**
- Every app is analyzed by the content of the app folder located in the data/data directory. The analysis generally involves data found in the specific app’s file folder and database folder but not limited to them. Another folder found in the data/data/app\_folder named “Shared Preference” contains some .xml files having app-related data. The same information is recovered by all three tools. Cache stores all the activity information and images/videos seen by the user while using the app and is recovered by all three tools. For example, the default Tinder app has a package named com.tinder and the data inside is stored in /data/data/com.tinder.
- Once the ADB has successfully established a connection to the Android device, developers can use the 'adb shell' command to execute various commands on the device itself. This capability provides direct access to the device's file system and allows for the manipulation of files and settings. In our scenario, we used the 'adb shell' command to search for the data of the Tinder app, which is stored in the '/data/data' folder. This allowed us to examine the app's data and potentially make modifications to it, which can be useful for various purposes such as analysis.

![Aspose Words 4262bab1-4a8f-4c6c-8240-7d23d4d7e40d 013](https://github.com/plue0709/Specialized_Project/assets/80806913/e4bbe164-4c3a-4166-a47f-323fc49ff297)


- In addition to executing commands on the Android device, the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) tool can also be used to transfer data from the device to a development machine for further analysis. This capability is achieved through the use of the **'adb pull'** command, which allows for the transfer of specific files or directories from the device to the computer. In our scenario, we used the 'adb pull' command to retrieve important data from the device for analysis. By pulling this data to our development machine, we were able to examine it in greater detail and gain valuable insights into the inner workings of the Tinder app.

1) ### <a name="_toc126937331"></a>***Analyzing cache***
- The Image Files of All Viewed Profile Pictures consist of two different file types: ".0" and ".1". The ".0" files contain a GET request that includes the URL of the image. This request is used to retrieve the image from the server and display it on the user's device. The ".1" files, on the other hand, contain the actual image file itself. These files store a copy of the image on the user's device, allowing it to be quickly and easily accessed without the need for a new GET request each time. Together, these two file types work to provide users with a seamless and efficient experience when viewing profile pictures. By storing both the GET request and the image file, the system is able to quickly and easily retrieve and display profile pictures, making it easier for users to browse and connect with other users on the platform.

- The app permissions listed below have been deemed to possess a dangerous level of access and usage, and therefore require caution and careful consideration.
- The **android.permission.ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION** permission in Android allows an app to access approximate location information, such as the location derived from Wi-Fi and mobile cell tower signals. This information can be used to provide location-based services, such as local search results or location-based advertising. It is important to note that this permission does not provide access to fine-grained (GPS-level) location information
- The **android.permission.ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION** is a permission in the Android operating system that allows an app to access the device's location data using GPS (Global Positioning System) or other location providers, such as Wi-Fi or cellular network. This permission provides the most accurate location data but also consumes more battery compared to android.permission.ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION.
- The **android.permission.CAMERA** is a permission in the Android operating system that allows an app to access the device's camera. This permission is required for apps that need to take pictures or videos, scan barcodes, or perform any other action that involves using the device's camera. When an app requests the camera permission, the user is prompted to grant or deny access. If the user grants access, the app can access the camera and perform camera-related tasks. If the user denies access, the app cannot access the camera and any camera-related features will be disabled.
- The **android.permission.RECORD\_AUDIO** is a permission in the Android operating system that allows an app to access the device's microphone. This permission is required for apps that need to record audio, such as voice memos, voice recording, or speech recognition. When an app requests the record audio permission, the user is prompted to grant or deny access. If the user grants access, the app can access the microphone and record audio. If the user denies access, the app cannot access the microphone and any audio recording features will be disabled.
- The **android.permission.WRITE\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE** is a permission in the Android operating system that allows an app to write data to the device's external storage. This could include an SD card or a portion of the device's internal storage that is designated as external storage. With this permission, an app can create, modify, or delete files and directories on the external storage. When an app requests the write external storage permission, the user is prompted to grant or deny access. If the user grants access, the app can write data to the external storage
- The **android.permission.READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE** is a permission in the Android operating system that allows an app to read data from the device's external storage. This could include an SD card or a portion of the device's internal storage that is designated as external storage. With this permission, an app can read files and directories on the external storage. When an app requests the read external storage permission, the user is prompted to grant or deny access.
- The **android.permission.READ\_PHONE\_STATE** permission in Android is a permission that allows an app to access information about the device's phone and data connectivity. This includes the phone number of the device, the status of any ongoing calls, the type of network the device is connected to (e.g., GSM, CDMA, LTE), and the device's IMEI number.

1) ### <a name="_toc126937334"></a>***Network*** 
After conducting a comprehensive analysis of all the .pcap files captured by Wireshark, it was observed that whenever users engage with the popular dating app, Tinder, they take advantage of HTTPS encryption to safeguard their network traffic.

`	`The privacy policy of Tinder is publicly available on the Internet

- **Data Collection**: Tinder collects a significant amount of personal information from its users, including name, profile picture, email address, and location data. This information can be a potential target for cybercriminals and malicious actors who might try to gain unauthorized access to it.

- **Data Sharing**: Tinder shares personal information with third-party service providers in order to provide its services, as well as with its affiliates and subsidiary companies. This could increase the risk of data breaches, as the more entities that have access to personal information, the more potential points of vulnerability there are.

- **Data Retention**: Tinder retains personal information for as long as necessary to provide its services or as required by law. However, if this data is not properly secured, it could be vulnerable to theft or unauthorized access.

- **Data Security**: Tinder states that it implements various security measures to protect personal information, including the use of encryption and firewalls. However, the level of security provided by these measures is not specified, and it's possible that they may not be sufficient to protect against all security threats.

- In conclusion, while the privacy policy of Tinder provides some information on how the app collects, uses, and shares personal information, there are some potential security risks that users should be aware of. To mitigate these risks, users may wish to consider taking additional steps to protect their personal information, such as  limiting the amount of personal information they share on the app.

In conclusion, the forensic analysis of the Tinder app is an important tool for understanding the app's usage and user behavior, as well as the types of information being collected and stored. By examining the app's privacy policy and security measures, as well as its data storage, forensic analysts can gain a better understanding of the types of information being collected and how it is being used.

One of the key benefits of forensic analysis is the ability to identify potential security risks or privacy concerns. For example, by examining the app's network traffic, analysts can determine whether sensitive information, such as user location or personal details, is being transmitted unencrypted or sent to third-party servers. This information can be used to improve the app's security measures and to protect users' privacy.

Another important aspect of forensic analysis is the ability to identify patterns and trends in user behavior. For example, by examining the app's data storage, analysts can determine whether users are engaging in any behavior that may put them at risk, such as sharing sensitive information with strangers or using the app in a potentially harmful manner. This information can be used to educate users and to improve the overall security and privacy of the app.

Finally, forensic analysis can also be used to support legal investigations and other types of dispute resolution. For example, by examining the app's data and network traffic, analysts can determine whether the app was being used to engage in illegal or unethical behavior, such as harassment or fraud.

In conclusion, the forensic analysis of the Tinder app is a valuable tool for improving the app's security, privacy, and overall user experience. Whether you are an individual user, a security professional, or a legal investigator, understanding the app's usage and data storage can help you make informed decisions and protect yourself from potential risks and dangers.
